We use this information in an effort to improve your experience on the Sites and to communicate with you about information that you request. We may also use this information to help us target specific services or offers to you, to contact you for

          JUMPNOW collects personal information that is voluntarily provided when users sign up for the JUMPNOW site or service. Specifically, when you sign up for our Platform through one of our Sites or interact with our widgets and bots. We ask you for personal information such as your name, address, social media connections, and email address. We may also request payment account information (such as PayPal or a credit card) which is encrypted and provided to third parties for the purpose of processing payment(s). In addition, JUMPNOW collects supplemental data from public sites, IP addresses, and connected social media channels (via an API for which you can select the types of information JUMPNOW may access), to create a more robust user profile and increase the odds that a marketer will locate your profile for content opportunities.
As a Creator agreeing to the Terms of Service and Privacy Notice when creating an account on our Site(s), you express consent to the access and collection of data and content from the social media accounts you have connected, including followers, friend lists, photos, videos, or similar content published through those social media accounts. You have the option to change these choices made at registration, at any time. However, the decision to disconnect a social media account will not remove content or data previously gathered under your authorization.
JUMPNOW will process the data
 acquired through your social media accounts to identify you and present your profile as a Creator to Marketers and Partners with access to our Site(s), so that they may offer you Opportunities within the Platform or using the Discovery feature.

          and provide payment account information. This data is required in order to make our services available to you.

           offers you may be interested in. You may control your email preferences within your account in the Platform.

For your protection, we only fulfil requests for the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity

          Please note that we often need to retain certain data for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transaction that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the personal information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion). Our databases and other records may have residual data which will not be removed. In addition, we also may not allow you to review certain data for legal, security or other reasons.
If at any time you believe that the Sites have not adhered
 to this Privacy Notice, please let us know. We will use good faith efforts to determine and correct the problem.
