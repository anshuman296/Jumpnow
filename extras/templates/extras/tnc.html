If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Marketplace or access the Sites. Accordingly, when you use the Marketplace, you should check the date of these Terms (which appears at the top of this document) and review any changes since the last

                    In the Terms, (i) a "Marketer" means any person or entity who participates in the Marketplace Services directly or by JUMPNOW authorized personnel on behalf of Marketer for the purpose of creating Opportunities to use the services of a Creator, (ii) "Creator" means any person, entity or group that creates and distributes the original content or sponsored social content, and/or performs an action, including but not limited to content posted through their associated social networks (i.e. Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc.), requested via the Marketplace, and receives compensation for such content or action via the Marketplace, (iii) "Affiliate" means any authorized entity or person that directly or indirectly controls the transactions of the Marketer or Creator. The term “control” with regard to this definition means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, written voting rights agreement, written agreement, title or other influence, (iv) “Opportunity” means a request by a Marketer for a Creator to create content, distribute sponsored social content, and/or perform an action through their social
                     network or in person. These Terms shall apply to all transactions conducted through the Marketplace.

            <div>
                <span>
                    Participating Marketers create and list Opportunities, often as part of a larger marketing goal (“Campaign”), in the Marketplace, which offer Creators the chance to receive compensation (e.g. cash, free products, publicity, etc.) in exchange for creating and/or distributing sponsored social content and/or performing an action through their social network or in person. There is no maximum number of Opportunities per Campaign. All Opportunities accepted by the Creator must comply with the requirements set forth by the Marketer (herein referred to as the "Requirements") in the Opportunity. Each Opportunity listing should contain a complete description of the requirements and the compensation to be paid by the Marketer. Marketers can also request that other ads be disabled on the paid content of an Opportunity. Once an Opportunity is accepted by a Creator, the Marketer is solely responsible for the review and approval of the Creator’s content and for the payment of any compensation (to be received and then distributed to Creator(s) by JUMPNOW) as stated in the Opportunity. JUMPNOW is not liable if payments are not made by Marketer. Marketer retains responsibility for payment of any or all approved offers and content under review, which will become immediately due and payable, regardless of whether or not Marketer’s access to the Platform is terminated.

                    To participate in Promoted Posts, Creators must grant JUMPNOW administrative access in the settings page of the applicable social media channel. This is a one-time action which establishes access for any Marketer with whom Creator is engaged in an Opportunity. For example, this permission can be deselected as part of the flow, per Facebook’s best practices:

                    JUMPNOW Pro fees are non-refundable and billed in advance. Subscriptions will automatically renew, unless cancelled prior to the next scheduled payment term. Marketer cannot sell, publish, or make any other use of Creator data beyond evaluating Creator for a marketing opportunity or similar permissible use. Marketer must comply with all applicable laws,
                     including privacy laws, in the collection, storage, and usage of any Creator or other Platform data.

                    While JUMPNOW personnel may assist in reviewing and identifying Creator's posts or actions that violate an Opportunity's Requirements and attempt to resolve disputes, JUMPNOW does not have privity of contract with the Creator and cannot enforce the terms agreed to between Creator and Marketer. JUMPNOW reserves the right to review and reject Opportunities from Marketers that do not meet the Marketplace Guidelines, as defined in Section 7 below. Posts which do not comply with the Requirements of the Opportunity will not be entitled to the compensation associated with such Opportunity. After Creator accepts an Opportunity and delivers the requested content to Marketer, the Marketer may respond with any requested modifications or may reject the post for failure to meet any agreed-upon criteria or for legal compliance issues. Final approval and payment to the Creator will occur if the link is active forty-five (45) days from approval, follows all disclosure guidelines and required elements. The Platform will automatically check for active posts and make payments to the Creator on behalf of the Marketer. If the automated system fails to locate required elements and disclosure, no payment will be made to the Creator and funds for the Opportunity will be returned to the Marketer, unless manually verified by JUMPNOW with permission from the Marketer or unless Creator makes the required edits. Should Marketer alter the forty-five-day payment terms with Creator, whether within or outside of the Platform, JUMPNOW shall not be held liable for any failure to make timely payment(s) to a Creator. Instead, Marketer shall be responsible for delivery of funds as agreed upon with Creator, utilizing Direct Pay or similar means. Further, if Marketer decides to pay Creator prior to the forty-five day mark at which Content is automatically verified in 
                    the Platform, the obligation to keep Content live for those initial 45 days is rendered null and void.

                <span>
                    If a Marketer makes changes to an Opportunity or approves content outside of the Platform, (i) those terms may not be enforceable as they are not contained within the terms and conditions of the Opportunity that are digitally agreed to by Creators, (ii) any failure of the Content during the verification process due to such changes will be Marketer’s responsibility, including any payments owed to Creators for delivering such content, and (iii) JUMPNOW shall not be responsible for ensuring that any items or advertising disclosures appear in the content. For the avoidance of doubt, JUMPNOW shall take no responsibility for non-compliance with contract terms (including payment terms and the length of time content must remain live), enforcement of terms entered into outside of the Platform,
                     or any claims, fines, or FTC violations resulting from Marketer’s actions or directions to JUMPNOW

                    Marketer shall comply with all applicable Federal Trade Commission and similar rules and regulations and other truth-in-advertising laws regarding content Marketer provides or has produced and/or published utilizing the Platform. Marketer is ultimately responsible for any FTC violations regarding the content it chooses to publish, regardless of whether or not JUMPNOW pushes through approvals in the Platform as directed by Marketer. If Marketer chooses not to use JUMPNOW’s automated FTC-compliant disclosures when publishing through the Platform, or encourages a Creator to publish outside the Platform, Marketer shall defend, indemnify, and hold JUMPNOW harmless from and against any claims arising in connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, JUMPNOW’s verification of any such content at Marketer’s direction or as a function of the
                     platform does not shift liability to JUMPNOW or waive JUMPNOW’s rights to indemnification.

                    You must be an adult (as defined by the jurisdiction in which you reside) to register as a Marketer or Creator in the Marketplace. Authorized agents may create accounts, with proof of authorization from the individual on whose behalf the account is created, and both the agent and the individual will be deemed bound by these Terms of Service. By registering in the Marketplace, you are representing and warranting that all information you submit is truthful and accurate, and that you agree to maintain the accuracy of such information. You understand and agree that JUMPNOW will use the information you provide in accordance with the terms of the JUMPNOW Privacy Notice (“Privacy Notice”), which is integrated into and included as part of

Minors (as defined by the jurisdiction in which you reside) must have a parent or legal guardian register for and establish a Creator account in the Marketplace. Parents or legal guardians may also allow minors to use their accounts in the Marketplace. Legally emancipated minors do not need a parent or legal guardian but may be required to show proof of emancipation. All minors must have executed and completed all required waivers and releases in order to participate in an Opportunity. For the avoidance of doubt, Minors are bound by the Terms, but this Section 2.1
                     controls in the event of any conflict with any other section or clause within the Terms.

In addition, any Opportunities in the system pertaining to alcohol, tobacco, drugs, medication, or other similar products or services that are illegal (as defined by the jurisdiction in which you reside) or intended for adults are not available for the minor (or their parent or legal guardian) to bid on or participate in. Whenever
                     a Marketer engages with a Minor, it is the Marketer’s responsibility to follow all applicable laws.

                    JUMPNOW requires clear and conspicuous disclosure by all Marketplace participants. More specifically, the connection between the Marketer and the Creator that would affect how people evaluate the Creator’s message must be disclosed. Any attempt to instruct, coerce or manipulate a Creator into hiding the commercial relationship between the Marketer and the Creator may result in immediate removal from the system and may be cause for JUMPNOW’s termination of any related contracts between JUMPNOW, Marketer, or Creator. Marketer agrees to comply with the ASCI guidelines [ <a target="_blank" href="https://asci.social/guidelines">https://asci.social/guidelines</a> ] and all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, those Marketers who choose not to use the approved pre-set ASCI disclosures for posts publishing through the Platform, or who encourage creators to publish outside of the Platform, acknowledge and agree that (i) Marketer, not JUMPNOW, is liable for any FTC violation, and (ii) 
                    JUMPNOW's manual verification of any such post in the Platform does not shift liability to JUMPNOW.

                    Unless otherwise agreed to in a separate contract between the parties, Marketer agrees to pay JUMPNOW all charges made to Marketer’s account for agreed-upon fees or use of the Marketplace Services in accordance with these Terms. If JUMPNOW does not receive timely payment and the balance in the Marketer account is not enough cover agreed upon fees or Marketplace Services hereunder: (i) a charge will be made to the Marketer’s credit card or other preferred payment method for the balance owed, (ii) Marketer agrees to pay all amounts due on its account upon demand, and (iii) JUMPNOW reserves the right to either suspend or terminate a Marketer’s account, including deletion of Marketer’s Opportunities from the Marketplace until the balance is paid in full. All fees for the Marketplace Services which are charged to Marketer account, as well as all deposit(s) for future Marketplace Services, are non-refundable. Marketer agrees to submit any disputes regarding any charge in writing to JUMPNOW within thirty (30) days of such charge, otherwise such dispute will be waived, and such charge will be final and not subject to challenge. In the event Marketer’s payment method cannot be charged, Marketer 
                    account will be locked until an alternative or updated method of payment is provided.

                    If Marketer fails to make payment as set forth herein, Marketer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by JUMPNOW in collecting such amounts. All prices are in United States dollars and do not include taxes that may be assessed by any jurisdiction. If withholding taxes or any other fees are imposed by any jurisdiction on the transactions pursuant to these Terms, Marketer shall pay such taxes to ensure that JUMPNOW receives the full amount invoiced without offset or deduction. Marketer agrees to promptly: (i) update all information to keep account and credit card billing current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address or e-mail), (ii) notify JUMPNOW in writing if it becomes aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of Marketer’s user name or password, and (iii) notify JUMPNOW in writing if its credit card is cancelled. Upon termination, suspension or discontinuation of the Marketplace or Marketer’s participation therein, all outstanding payment obligations incurred 
                    by Marketer under the Marketplace will become immediately due and payable.

If charged, this fee is non-refundable. The inactivity fee is Rs.2500 after 180 days, Rs.5000 after 210 days,
                     and the balance remaining in the account, if any, after 240 days of inactivity.

                    If a Marketer does not wish to send money directly to JUMPNOW via check or ACH, Marketer authorizes JUMPNOW to charge Marketer’s credit card, as approved and provided by the Marketer, in advance to deposit funds into the Marketer’s account. Once funds are deposited into the Marketer’s account, they may be used at the Marketer’s discretion, to purchase Marketplace Services or pay for agreed upon fees. Marketer will be responsible for charges resulting from the use of Marketplace Services and any applicable service fees will be automatically withdrawn.
Marketer represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use any credit card utilized in connection with any transaction. By submitting such information, Marketers grants JUMPNOW the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by the Marketer. If the credit card provided was not authorized, then all amounts in the Marketer’s account will immediately be forfeited. Marketer’s non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace reaffirms that JUMPNOW
 is authorized to charge Marketer’s credit card.

If JUMPNOW modifies the terms of the method of payment as outlined in this Section 3.3, the Marketer will be contacted by JUMPNOW or the modifications will be reflected in an updated version of these Terms. If a user does not consent to such modified Terms, such user must immediately discontinue using the Marketplace. A user’s continued enrolment 
                    after any modifications constitutes its acceptance of the terms and method of payment as modified.

                     Campaign for a fee as agreed upon through a separate managed service agreement. Interested parties should contact JUMPNOW directly.

                    Marketer agrees that JUMPNOW is not responsible for any aspect of Marketer's content or product to be reviewed, shared, sponsored, or advertised by the Marketplace’s contracted Creators. Marketer represents, warrants and covenants that: (i) all information it provides or approves or that is provided on its behalf in connection with the Terms and on Marketer’s website(s) is, and will be updated to remain, current and accurate, (ii) the website to which any links are included in a listed Opportunity will look substantially the same to all end users regardless of the end users' location or device, (iii) the Marketer’s website(s) does not contain any JUMPNOW-owned or licensed content, except pursuant to a separate signed agreement with JUMPNOW, (iv) Campaigns are run in compliance with third party platform terms, and JUMPNOW takes no responsibility for such compliance or third parties. Marketer acknowledges that Creators are independent third parties and not directly controlled by JUMPNOW. As a consequence, any blog postings or sponsorship of Marketer’s content or product(s) will inherently risk negative or unflattering comments about Marketer’s content, product(s) or company. Marketer specifically acknowledges and agrees that JUMPNOW (unless the Campaign is being fully managed by JUMPNOW) has no control over any content that may be available or published on any blog (or otherwise), and that Marketer, even if being fully managed by JUMPNOW, is 
                    solely responsible (and assumes all liability and risk) for determining whether or not such Content is appropriate or acceptable to Marketer.

Forty-five (45) days after verification of the Opportunity, payment will be made to the Creator by JUMPNOW for services unless the Creator has violated these Terms, the specific terms of the Marketer’s Opportunity, or the Marketer has not remitted fees per the term of its contract. In the event that Marketer cancels or delays a Campaign or Opportunity and the Creator has submitted work in accordance with the Opportunity guidelines, the Creator may be entitled to some compensation
                     from Marketer if and as indicated in the Opportunity.

Should an Opportunity contain supplemental terms between Marketer and Creator, the Content shall also be subject to those supplemental terms,

                    Creators participating in the Marketplace must clearly disclose in their sponsored content the relationship between themselves and the Marketers. JUMPNOW requires that disclosure be made in a meaningful way that makes clear to an ordinary consumer that there is a relationship between the Creator and the Marketer. JUMPNOW reserves the right to review and monitor the disclosure practices of all Creators who participate in the Marketplace and to either require greater levels of disclosure (in the event that JUMPNOW determines in its sole discretion that current disclosure practices – including placement of clear and conspicuous disclosure - are inadequate) or remove the Creator or Creator’s content from the Marketplace (in the event of inadequate disclosures). Creator agrees to comply with the Advertising Standard Council of India [ ASCI ] ( see generally <a target="_blank" href="https://asci.social/guidelines ">https://asci.social/guidelines </a> ) and to comply with all applicable local, state, federal and international laws and regulations in the preparation and delivery of Content. Any violations of the above terms by Creator may be cause for termination of any relevant contracts or 
                    Opportunities involving Creator.

                    Sponsored content posted for an Opportunity must remain linked and live for a minimum of forty-five (45) consecutive days (unless otherwise specified in the Opportunity) in order for the Marketplace to validate the fulfilment of the Opportunity and to earn compensation for the posted Opportunity. Unless Creator is the recipient of Direct Pay as determined by a Marketer, after forty-five (45) days from publication and upon successful validation of the Opportunity, the Creator will receive payment for the completion of the Opportunity as 
                    agreed upon between the Marketer and the Creator in the Opportunity.

                    Creators, as part of any Opportunity they are contracted for, have an obligation to keep confidential any and all materials provided to them by Marketers. This obligation survives the end, cancellation, or termination of any agreements between Marketers and Creators.

                    If Creator accepts an Opportunity yet fails to fully perform and meet the obligations thereof, JUMPNOW may lower Creator’s rating in the system, post negative reviews, and potentially remove Creator and Creator’s account from any and all JUMPNOW platforms, and Marketer may (i) deny payment to Creator for such failure to perform, and/or, (ii) take back any products, documents, or other items Creator received. Creator shall promptly return any such items requested by Marketer.
                     Any Creator content prior to such failure or otherwise paid for is owned by the Marketer who posted the Opportunity.

                    If necessary, a Marketer may request that a Creator’s post in response to an Opportunity be removed from the Creator’s social media channel or personal website. JUMPNOW may assist Marketer in requesting a Creator to remove a post and additional fees may apply; however, JUMPNOW cannot guarantee removal
                     of the post by the Creator. Marketer may also request that an Opportunity be closed and/or cancelled at any time.

            <div>

                    Marketer may owe payment to Creator, whether partial or full, based on how much Content was submitted or completed prior to Marketer’s request to remove Content or cancel an Opportunity.

                    Should Creator be asked to reasonably modify or to remove content posted in connection with an Opportunity, Creator must do so within twenty-four (24) hours of receiving such instruction. Failure to do so may result in a loss of compensation (including a clawback of monies already paid
                     to Creator) and other remedies, up to and including removal from the Marketplace and termination for cause of any related contracts.

                    Creator acknowledges and agrees that the obligation to compensate Creator for Opportunity-related advertisements resides with the Marketer, not JUMPNOW. JUMPNOW merely facilitates such compensation on behalf of the Marketers. Marketer is solely liable for providing the funds to JUMPNOW for payment to Creator. While JUMPNOW may be remitting payment to Creator directly; under no circumstance does JUMPNOW accept liability for payment to Creator. JUMPNOW may also deny payments to Creator subject to any legal or lawful purpose. Creator agrees that it will not pursue any actions, legal or otherwise, against JUMPNOW for non-payment. Creator waives any and all claims or rights of action against JUMPNOW relating to the failure of a Marketer to compensate Creator in connection with an Opportunity-related advertisement. In addition, Creator acknowledges that Creator is: (i) not an employee of JUMPNOW, (ii) responsible for the payment of all federal, state and local taxes on compensation received from a Marketer, (iii) responsible for any reporting requirements imposed by the federal, state or local government, 
                    and (iv) responsible for compliance with all other applicable laws and regulations.

            <div>
                <span>
                    If Creator enrols in a subscription agreement or agrees to other charges to its account, Creator may be asked to provide a form of payment such as a credit card or PayPal account. Creator represents and warrants that it has the legal right to use such form of payment utilized in connection with any transaction. By submitting such information, Creator grants JUMPNOW the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of transactions initiated by the Creator. Creator’s non-termination or continued use of the Marketplace reaffirms that JUMPNOW is authorized to charge Creator’s credit card for the use of the requested Marketplace Services. In the event Creator’s payment method was not authorized or cannot be charged for any agreed upon fees, the Creator’s account will be locked.
If a Creator account is or becomes inactive for 180 consecutive days, defined as not logging into said account for 180 consecutive days, the balance in the account attributable to accrued promotional funds and referral fees will begin incurring charges for inactivity fees. The Creator acknowledges and agrees that the inactivity fee is Rs.250 after 180 days, Rs.500 after 210 days, and the balance remaining in the account, if any, after 240 days of inactivity. If charged, this fee is non-refundable. For the avoidance of doubt, monies earned by Creators via an Opportunity are 
not subject to these inactivity fees.

                    a. Sponsored Social Content – Content is created by a Creator for Marketer’s marketing Campaign and is submitted, posted, displayed, or shared to Creator’s followers through his or her personal social media platforms. Unless otherwise indicated in an Opportunity, Content is owned by Creator, but JUMPNOW and Marketer receive a worldwide, perpetual, fully paid-up, royalty-free, and fully sublicensable right and license to share, use, copy, process, adapt, translate, display, perform, reproduce, republish, and distribute the content or any portion thereof in any and all forms of media or distribution methods (now known or hereafter developed), including but not limited to television, radio, print, Internet site and other electronic communications. Any use, publishing, or distribution of a Creator’s content must be accompanied by credit to the Creator of that content by use of the Creator’s name, likeness, image, username/handle or other identifying representation (to which Marketer will receive a limited license). While Marketer has the right to reuse the Content outside of its native platform, as described above, FTC guidelines state that the connection between the Creator and the Marketer (or brand) must be disclosed and the Content must be attributed to the Creator.
                     The disclosure should also clearly and conspicuously communicate that the Creator is paid by or works with the Marketer (or brand).

            <div>

                    b. Content Production – Content is created as commissioned by Marketer, without limitation as to how that Content may be used now or in the future. JUMPNOW will facilitate Creator’s assignment of all rights in such Content to Marketer. Marketers purchasing Original Content shall own the copyright in and to the Content and may use, reproduce, have reproduced, edit for length or clarity, publish and exploit such Content in its sole discretion, including, without limitation, licensing the Content to any agent or third party, copying, distributing, displaying, publicly
                     performing, and creating derivative works of the Content. Attribution to the Creator is optional, unless the Content is created by a Celebrity.

            <div>
                <span>
                    c. Celebrity Creator Content – Celebrity profile accounts are generally denoted with a unique banner within the Platform. Celebrity creators may need a special contract between Marketer and celebrity Creator to be completed, and any such contract shall be managed by the Marketer. Marketer and its Client (if applicable) understand and agree that in the event a celebrity is requested to create, provide, or endorse any Sponsored Social Content pursuant to a Statement of Work between JUMPNOW and such celebrity Creator, the celebrity Creator retains ownership rights to the Content and any terms surrounding its use must be negotiated in a separate agreement between JUMPNOW and the celebrity Creator. Marketer and its Client will be advised of all 
                    relevant use limitations for licensed celebrity Creator content.

                    Marketers may choose to use this feature within the platform to reimburse Creators for expenses incurred on an Opportunity, transactions completed outside of the workflow or platform, or for payments that must be released outside the typical 45-day payment window. Creators may submit items for payment, but Marketers have discretion regarding what will be approved. Funds will issue from a Marketer’s account immediately upon authorization of the payment, and any amounts issued through the Direct Pay feature are not refundable. A transaction fee will be assessed to Marketers for any payments facilitated using Direct Pay within the Platform. This transaction fee is 
                    assigned upon account creation. The Direct Pay feature is also subject to a monthly maximum dollar amount, which is set and controlled by JUMPNOW.
